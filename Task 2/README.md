#  Student Management System (Java CLI)

This is a simple Java-based command-line application to manage student records.

##  What I Have Done

- Created a `Student` class with ID, name, and marks fields.
- Used `ArrayList` to store multiple student objects.
- Implemented basic CRUD operations:
  -  Add a student
  -  View all students
  -  Update student details by ID
  -  Delete a student by ID
- Built a menu-driven loop to handle user input using `Scanner`.

##  How to Run

```bash
javac studentdata.java
java studentdata
```

##  Example Menu

```
1. Add Student
2. View Students
3. Update Student
4. Delete Student
5. Exit
```

This program is ideal for learning the basics of Java OOP, collections, and user input handling.
