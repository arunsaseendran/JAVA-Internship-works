# Simple Java Calculator

This is a basic command-line calculator built in Java that performs simple arithmetic operations.

##  What I Have Done

- Created separate methods for:
  -  Addition
  -  Subtraction
  -  Multiplication
  -  Division
- Used `Scanner` to take input from the user.
- Implemented a continuous loop to:
  - Accept two numbers
  - Accept an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  - Display the result based on the chosen operation

##  How to Run

```bash
javac calculator.java
java calculator
```

##  Sample Output

```
=================== Simple Java Calculator ===================
Enter First Number : 
10

 Enter Operation to be Performed '+','-','*','/' :
*

Enter Second Number : 
5
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
```

> Note: The calculator runs continuously; use `Ctrl + C` to exit.

This program is a great way to understand how methods, input handling, and control flow work in Java.
